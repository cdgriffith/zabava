**Very messy work in progress! Still flushing out ideas!**

## Design

All files are encrypted. 

Covers are AES256 JPG images
Media is MPEG-DASH Encrypted (AES128)

Data will be stored on remote server like: 

    bucket/
        covers/ 
            0000001
            0000002
            ...
        mpeg_dash/
            0000001/
                stream.mpd
                audio/<lang>/<type>/
                    init.mp4
                    seg-1.m4s 
                    ...
                video/<type>/
                    init.mp4
                    seg-1.m4s 
                    ...
            0000002/
            ...
            
            
Info about the files will be stored in a locally encrypted Mongo Database
